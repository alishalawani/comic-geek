# Comic Geek App

## Project Description
My app, Comic Geek, is an app that provides information about Marvel and DC comic characters. Having a lot of friends that are big fans of Marvel and DC I decided to create an app where they can find information or facts about different comic characters at their fingertips. In the future I would like to add a feature where the user can find information about all of the Marvel and DC characters with no limit.

### User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to navigate to different pages for marvel and DC characters respectively so I don't get the characters mixed up.
- As a user, I want to be able to search for a specific character on among the ones available on the app so I don't have to go through the whole list of characters every time.
- As a user I want to be able to click on a character and find more details about that comic character so I can get more information about that character.

### Stretch Goals
- As a user I want to be able to search for villains and superheroes respectively incase I forget what role each character played.
- As a user I want to be able to find characters of other Comic publishers so I am not limited to only Marvel and DC.

## Issues
[Superhero Api](https://superheroapi.com/) has data about some characters misplaced so I made arrays of names of Marvel and DC comic characters that have reliable data. 

## Technologies
- React js, React Bootstrap, Javascript, CSS, HTML5, Axios.

### How to Install Comic Geek 
- Fork and Clone this repository
- In the repository, run npm install 

### Contributions
I wont be accepting contributions at the moment as this is a personal project and is meant to be a solo project. If you come across any issue while using/installing the app, you can submit an issue on this repository and I will make sure to see to it.
